This study utilizes publicly available data from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Web Application Programming Interface (API). In this paper, various machine learning techniques are demonstrated to explore, analyze and recommend similar proposal abstracts to aid the NSF or Awardee with the Merit Review Process. These techniques extract textual context and group it with similar context. The goal of the analysis was to utilize a Doc2Vec unsupervised learning algorithms to embed NSF funding proposal abstracts text into vector space.  Once vectorized, the abstracts were grouped together using K-means clustering. These techniques together proved to be successful at grouping similar proposals together and could be used to find similar proposals to newly submitted NSF funding proposals. 
To perform text analysis, SAS速 University Edition is used which supports SASPy, SAS速 Studio and Python JupyterLab. Gensim Doc2vec is used to generate document vectors for proposal abstracts. Afterwards, document vectors were used to cluster similar abstracts using SAS速 Studio KMeans Clustering Module. For visualization, the abstract embeddings were reduced to two dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) within SAS速 Studio. This was then compared to a t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction technique as part of the Scikit-learn machine learning toolkit for Python.
Conclusively, NSF proposal abstract text analysis can help an awardee read and improve their proposal model by identifying similar proposal abstracts from the last 24 years. It could also help NSF evaluators identify similar existing proposals that indirectly provides insights on whether a new proposal is going to be fruitful or not.
